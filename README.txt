This website builds upon the assignments that we have completed throughout this term.
"sayit" is an imageboard website, where people can post text and images as well as reply to another post, thus beginning a thread.
Clicking the original poster's author name or any of the "reply" links will display all of the posts in the appropriate thread.
Clicking the logo at the top will return the user to the home page and display all posts.
Many of the fields in the create post modal are optional, with the default values previewed in their appropriate text field.
Users that opt not to include an image with their post are provided with a default "profile picture" (if you can call it that).
Post content that would normally exceed the bounds of its container should either wrap or allow the use of a scroll bar localized to the container (depending on the window size).
Upon entering a "faulty" link, users are directed to the '404' page.

USE:
npm install (should install four libraries)
npm start (should listen on port 3000)
